# üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm Salad10 (Salad), a student developer with a passion for Python programming, computational biology, cybersecurity, and AI. I love solving problems and building projects that push me to think in new ways.

üå± My journey into coding started when I built a chatbot called Abstract. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it taught me a huge amount about how AI and chatbots work, and it‚Äôs what first sparked my love for programming. I have also managed to access my schools internal servers and there was this one time where our music teacher kept giving us homework so i hacked his account and changed his password so he couldn't log on. 

üíª I‚Äôve explored coding through multiple paths:
‚Ä¢ Computational Biology ‚Äì using Python to work with data and explore biological systems
‚Ä¢ Cybersecurity ‚Äì learning through hands-on vulnerability discovery and secure coding practices
‚Ä¢ Languages ‚Äì studying French, completing GCSE early and continuing at A-level
‚Ä¢ Competitions ‚Äì
‚Ä¢ UK CanSat Competition where I contributed to design and testing under real-world constraints coding a satellite that collected altitude and temperature data then streamed it back down to a ground station
‚Ä¢ Big Ideas Competition where I worked on innovative solutions for real-world challenges
‚Ä¢ Coding Competitions that sharpened my algorithmic problem-solving under pressure

üî¨ I‚Äôm especially motivated by challenges that mix science, code, and creativity. My long-term aim is to bring together biology, AI, and security to make tools and research that genuinely matter.
