# 💫 About Me:
I’m Salade10 (Noah), a student developer with a passion for Python programming, computational biology, cybersecurity, and AI. I love solving problems and building projects that push me to think in new ways.

🌱 My journey into coding started when I built a chatbot called Abstract. It wasn’t perfect, but it taught me a huge amount about how AI and chatbots work, and it’s what first sparked my love for programming. I also have hands in experience with penetration testing and am always keen to learn and recieve feedback. 

# 💻 I’ve explored coding through multiple paths:

• Computational Biology – I understand the underlying principles of biology and have coded many biological models. Many of my models have used python libraries such as matplotlib to plot the data as the simulation progresses.

• Cybersecurity – I have coded keyloggers, wordlist generators and other types of malware, this has helped me learn how they work and therefore allows me to help protect against them better. I code python and understand networks and cloud systems. I have had real experience accessing and pentesting accounts and systems.

• Languages – studying French has helped me greatly and has allowed me to communicate with programmers and developers from other countries. 

# Competitions:

• UK CanSat Competition where I contributed to design and testing under real-world constraints coding a satellite that collected altitude and temperature data then streamed it back down to a ground station

• Big Ideas: I had to design a product that would help the planet. I decided to design a food waste compacter that supermarkets, businesses and schools could use to reduce their food waste

• Ive participated in coding competitions and WAICY. I attended a webinar on robotics development and AI and after participated in the competition of designing an AI to help humans. I came up wioth a bot called patrick which would advise low income countries where and how to invest their money.

🔬 I’m especially motivated by challenges that mix science, code, and problem solving. My Goal is to leave an imprint on humanity and give it something new, interesting and a way forward.
