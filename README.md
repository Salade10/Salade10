# üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm Salade10 (Salade), a student developer with a passion for Python programming, computational biology, cybersecurity, and AI. I love solving problems and building projects that push me to think in new ways.

üå± My journey into coding started when I built a chatbot called Abstract. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it taught me a huge amount about how AI and chatbots work, and it‚Äôs what first sparked my love for programming. I have also managed to access my schools internal servers and there was this one time where our music teacher kept giving us homework so i hacked his account and changed his password so he couldn't log on. 

# üíª I‚Äôve explored coding through multiple paths:

‚Ä¢ Computational Biology ‚Äì I understand the underlying principles of biology and have coded many biological models

‚Ä¢ Cybersecurity ‚Äì I have coded keyloggers, wordlist generators and other types of malware. I code python and understand networks and cloud systems. I have had real experience accessing and pentesting accounts and systems.

‚Ä¢ Languages ‚Äì studying French has helped me greatly and has allowed me to communicate with programmers and developers from other countries.

# Competitions:

‚Ä¢ UK CanSat Competition where I contributed to design and testing under real-world constraints coding a satellite that collected altitude and temperature data then streamed it back down to a ground station

‚Ä¢ Big Ideas: I had to design a product that would help the planet https://github.com/Salade10/The-rotters-big-idea-competition

‚Ä¢ Coding Competitions that sharpened my algorithmic problem-solving under pressure

üî¨ I‚Äôm especially motivated by challenges that mix science, code, and problem solving. My Goal is to leave an imprint on humanity and give it something new, interesting and a way forward.
